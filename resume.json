  "professional_summary": "For me, coding is more than just making things work—it's about connecting with the people who will use what I create. Every detail, from design to performance, is an opportunity to shape a meaningful human experience. Over the past two years, I've specialized in building modern, high-performance web applications using Next.js, React.js, and TypeScript. These tools aren't just technical choices; they're how I craft seamless, accessible, and intuitive digital experiences. My goal is always to bridge robust technology with real user needs, ensuring that every line of code I write translates into frictionless, engaging, and impactful interactions.",
